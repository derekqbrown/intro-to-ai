This contains documents for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at WGU (C951)

The course is broken into three parts: 
1. Creation of a chatbot using an online service called Pandorabots
2. Creation of a simulated bot that has at least two different sensors that allow it to interact with a simulated environment (this uses CoppeliaSim)
3. Creation of a project proposal for a machine learning model

Documentation is included for each part.

To utilize the files in this repository will require logging into Pandorabots website for part 1, and downloading the CoppeliaSim for part 2.

Also included is a demo video for part 2, showing the bot navigating and reacting to the simulated environment
