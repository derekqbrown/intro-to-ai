This contains documents for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at WGU (C951)

The course is broken into three parts: 
1. Creation of a chatbot using an online service called Pandorabots
2. Creation of a simulated bot that has at least two different sensors that allow it to interact with a simulated environment (this uses CoppeliaSim)
3. Creation of a project proposal for a machine learning model

To utilize the files in this repository will require logging into Pandorabots website for part 1, downloading the CoppeliaSim for part 2, and a program that can view Word documents for part three.
